# Minesweeper

This is the game Minesweeper made in C using the Raylib graphics libray.
The project is just for fun.

### Running the game

At the moment there is no executable file to run the game, it has to be built using a script and only works with consoles supporting bash for now.

To build and run the game, simply CD to the folder where the game is located:
```bash
cd your/path/Minesweeper-C
```

Followed by this in the game folder:
```bash
./start.sh
```
